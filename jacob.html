    <h1>Developer Notes:</h1>
    <p><strong>Jan 25</strong>: 
        This was our first week meeting with the customer, Mike Flamm, and discussing the project. 
        We talked about major requirements and set a schedule for future meetings.
        We hope to look at the database as a team next week.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 1</strong>: 
        We accessed the current database via AWS and logged into HeidiSQL.
        We also further discussed requirement details with Mike this week, and we 
        hope to develop a plan for merging the two database tables together by next week.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 8</strong>: 
        We looked at the database in more detail this week, and met with Mike to discuss our
        plan for merging two tables in the database together. I will be looking into 
        using Python to alter the database next week along with John.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 15</strong>: 
        Over the past week I figured out how to use Python to alter the database. This should
        help us more easily perform queries and edit the tables and columns. We also told Mike
        that we believe we can merge the two tables together by the week before spring break.
        Next week, we hope to continue the merge process and finish up the project plan.</p>
