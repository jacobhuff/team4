    <h1>Developer Notes:</h1>
    <p><strong>Jan 25</strong>: 
        This was our first week meeting with the customer, Mike Flamm, and discussing the project. 
        We talked about major requirements and set a schedule for future meetings. We did not complete any work
        as we have not had a chance to look at the database yet, which we plan to do next week.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 1</strong>: 
        We managed to access the current database via AWS and logged into HeidiSQL thanks to great documentation
        that was provided to us by last year's team. We did not look at the actual data in too much detail, however.
        We also further discussed requirement details with Mike this week, and we 
        hope to develop a plan for merging the two database tables together by next week. We will look at the
        database in further detail next week to get an idea as to how we are going to meet the requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 8</strong>: 
        We looked at the database in more detail this week, and met with Mike to discuss our
        plan for merging two tables in the database together. I will be looking into 
        using Python to alter the database next week along with John. We hope to at least merge some of the data
        by next week's meeting with Mike. This will most likely be done using SQL queries in HeidiSQL.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 15</strong>: 
        Over the past week I figured out how to use Python to alter the database. This should
        help us more easily perform queries and edit the tables and columns. We also told Mike
        that we believe we can merge the two tables together by the week before spring break.
        Next week, we hope to continue the merge process and finish up the project plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 22</strong>: 
        This past week mainly consisted of continuing our work on merging the two tables in the database.
        We added some new columns to the tables in an effort to make the merging process easier. We think that by
        matching certain columns and keywords that we should be able to merge a large sum of the data. We did find
        an issue where all information about the cars were the same except for their curb weights, so we brought
        this up to Mike in our meeting. He said to ignore all duplicate cars except for the ones with the lightest weight.
        He also reminded us of our spring break deadline, and told us to continue with the merging process.</p>
    <p><strong>March 1</strong>: 
        We are currently continuing work on merging together the two tables in the database. It is going to be 
        difficult since there is a lot of data that is not going to be caught by our queries, but that still 
        need to be merged properly. We will finish the initial merge before spring break, and then perform maintenance 
        afterwards to correct any errors that occured during the merge.</p>
