    <h1>Developer Notes:</h1>
    <p><strong>Jan 25</strong>: 
        This was our first week meeting with the customer, Mike Flamm, and discussing the project. 
        We talked about major requirements and set a schedule for future meetings.
        We hope to look at the database as a team next week.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 1</strong>: 
        We accessed the current database via AWS and logged into HeidiSQL.
        We also further discussed requirement details with Mike this week, and we 
        hope to develop a plan for merging the two database tables together by next week.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 8</strong>: 
        We looked at the database in more detail this week, and met with Mike to discuss our
        plan for merging two tables in the database together. I will be looking into 
        using Python to alter the database next week along with John.</p>
