    <h1>Developer Notes:</h1>
    <p><strong>Jan 25 </strong>:
        We met with Mike Flamm and the other delta v group. We discussed the project and the requirements. 
        A schedule was set for future meetings and slack was established as a means for communicating with
        Mike. We hope to look over the database over the next week.</p>
    <p><strong> Jan 31  </strong>:
        We logged onto the database on AWS using HeidiSQL and the user manual provided by the previous
        team.We disscused the requirements in further detail.We hope to develop a plan for merging the two 
        tables by the end of the week. We went over the use case modeling assignment as a team and came up with
        two use cases.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 7</strong>:
        We met with Mike again and discussed the feasibility of merging the two tables.He also brought up the idea
        of an password recovery, but as this out the scope we will not focus on unless we finish merging ahead of schedule.
        The issue seems to be that there isn't enough info in the vehicle additional(V_A) table columns to merge with the vehicle spec.
        table without creating countless duplicates. There is also the issue that some of the columns in the V_S table are missing info.
        The model name in vehicle additional contains some useful info but its not consistent throughtout the entire table with some having
        a lot of info and others only having a single word.I will be looking into extracting info from the model name in the V_A table 
        and inserting into new columns.The plan is to get as many columns that we can merge with the columns in the vehicle_spec table.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 11</strong>
        I created two now columns in vehicle_additional, car_doors and drive. Extracted the number of car doors and the type of 
        drive(front,rear,all,four wheeled drive).Difficulties encountered as many model names lacked info on car_doors and drive
         and were just left blank. Also some had 2x2 which refers to 2 wheeled drive, which can also refer to either front or rear 
        wheeled drive.Same case with 4x4 referring to four or all wheeled drive.</p>
    <p><strong> Feb 14</strong>
        After running a few joining queries to see how much progress has been made, discovered that there seem to multiple copies
        of the same car with the exact info in every column. After running a query for distinct rows in V_A table I found out there are 
        about 19,000 distinct rows compared to the original 28,000. 
        
        Meet with Mike and discussed my findings of multiple duplicates in V_A table. Decided upon making a copy of both tables 
        and working on testing tables. Will delete duplicate rows and continue to look for ways to make the merge as accurate as 
        possible. Set a deadline of before spring break to complete merging and then working with other delta v group to make any
        necessary database changed they need. Might focus only on cars made after 1983 for the merge as those cars typically have every 
        column filled out in the V_A table.</p>
