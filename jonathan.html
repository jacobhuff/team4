    <h1>Developer Notes:</h1>
    <p><strong>Jan 25 </strong>:
        We met with Mike Flamm and the other delta v group. We discussed the project and the requirements. 
        A schedule was set for future meetings and slack was established as a means for communicating with
        Mike. We hope to look over the database over the next week.</p>
    <p><strong> Jan 31  </strong>:
        We logged onto the database on AWS using HeidiSQL and the user manual provided by the previous
        team.We disscused the requirements in further detail.We hope to develop a plan for merging the two 
        tables by the end of the week. We went over the use case modeling assignment as a team and came up with
        two use cases.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 7</strong>:
        We met with Mike again and discussed the feasibility of merging the two tables.He also brought up the idea
        of an password recovery, but as this out the scope we will not focus on unless we finish merging ahead of schedule.
        The issue seems to be that there isn't enough info in the vehicle additional(V_A) table columns to merge with the vehicle spec.
        table without creating countless duplicates. There is also the issue that some of the columns in the V_S table are missing info.
        The model name in vehicle additional contains some useful info but its not consistent throughtout the entire table with some having
        a lot of info and others only having a single word.I will be looking into extracting info from the model name in the V_A table 
        and inserting into new columns.The plan is to get as many columns that we can merge with the columns in the vehicle_spec table.</p>
    <p><strong>Feb 11</strong>
        I created two now columns in vehicle_additional, car_doors and drive. Extracted the number of car doors and the type of 
        drive(front,rear,all,four wheeled drive).Difficulties encountered as many model names lacked info on car_doors and drive
         and were just left blank. Also some had 2x2 which refers to 2 wheeled drive, which can also refer to either front or rear 
        wheeled drive.Same case with 4x4 referring to four or all wheeled drive.</p>
    <p><strong> Feb 14</strong>
        After running a few joining queries to see how much progress has been made, discovered that there seem to multiple copies
        of the same car with the exact info in every column. After running a query for distinct rows in V_A table I found out there are 
        about 19,000 distinct rows compared to the original 28,000. 
        
        Meet with Mike and discussed my findings of multiple duplicates in V_A table. Decided upon making a copy of both tables 
        and working on testing tables. Will delete duplicate rows and continue to look for ways to make the merge as accurate as 
        possible. Set a deadline of before spring break to complete merging and then working with other delta v group to make any
        necessary database changed they need. Might focus only on cars made after 1983 for the merge as those cars typically have every 
        column filled out in the V_A table.</p>
    <p><strong> Feb 21 </strong>
        Found cases where make,model name, year and other vehicle specs except for one vehicle spec. Mike Flamm believes this to be cases where
        a slightly different body or different engine is used, but since it isn't specified in the columns we just have to assume this is true.An example of this
        is where there would be 3 dodge neon 2 door sedan and they would have the same columns,except for different curb weights.To handle these
        cases we've been advised to simply go with smallest measurement to be on the safe side. Otherwise we have made good progress and we should
        have the tables merged. The rows that we can't be merged will be inserted in vehicle_specs.We plan to have the merging done before spring break
        and after we can focus on the database side of the desktop application.</p>
    <p><strong> Feb28 </strong>
        Good progress was made in figuring out the merge process. We encountered a situation where the make,model,and year were the same as well 
        as other columns except for the curbweight. We brought this up to mike and discovered that the files used to import were labeled with a year,
        but just because it had that year did not mean that it has info on just cars made that year. Mike couldn't explain why there were different
        curbweights for the same car and we ultimately decided to re import the files in order and use the information from the latest file. So if a
        car apperead in the 1995,1996, and 1997 file we would use the 1997 file info for the car.We're assuming that the latest file has the most
        accurate info. After doing this we reduced the database down from 20,000 rows to a little under 14,000 rows.</p>
    <p><strong>March 7</strong>
          Merging was completed. I'm planning on running some maintenance to make sure none of the inserted rows are going to create issues when
        searching with the mobile app and desktop. Maintenance will probably be run throughout the rest of the semester to verify the accuracy of the 
        database. The plan is to work with the desktop team more after spring break. As well as work with the mobile app developer hired by mike 
        to give him access to the database and make any queries that he needs.
