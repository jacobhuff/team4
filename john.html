    <h1>Developer Notes:</h1>
    <p><strong>1/25/19</strong>
        First meeting with Mike. We met jointly with the other group that will be working with him. Most of the meeting was spent with
        Mike introducing us to the project, what was accomplished last year, where it is now, and what he hopes to have done this semester.
        We laid out a schedule for future meetings and set up a slack channel.</p>
    
    <p><strong>1/31/19</strong>
        Took a brief look at the database over the past week. It was a bit confusing since we hadn't yet gotten the full details
        of what we're supposed to be working on.
        
        During our weekly meeting with Mike, we agreed on a goal of merging two tables in the database, one older table with vehicle
        data in it, and another newer on with Canadian vehicle data in it.
        
        My goal for next week is to acquaint myself with the vehicle data tables and begin formulating a plan for how to merge them.</p>
    <p><strong>2/7/19</strong>
        We took a look at the tables over the past week and came to the conclusion that with a few changes to the formatting of the new
        one, merging will be entirely possible.
        
        During our meeting with Mike we shared this with him, and created a tentative plan to finish the merge over the next 2-3 weeks.
        We also discussed the reformatting of the new database and Mike gave us some guidance regarding what information is important
        and what isn't. Mike also brought up an idea of working with another guy on a login project where we will be helping implement
        password recovery. With the current state of the database, this project seems to be mostly implemented already but is beyond the
        current scope of our project. No plans to work on it unless we finish our current project.
        
        Over the next week I plan on helping to reformat the Canadian table by splitting up a column that appears as two separate 
        columns in the old table.</p>
    <p><strong>2/14/19</strong>
        Busy with schoolwork over past week, not much work to show.

        During our weekly meeting with Mike we discussed the need for security of the data we are using. We agreed on creating more tables
        that are duplicates of the current vehicle tables so we can work with them more quickly by not having to worry about accidentally
        irreversible screwing something up. We discussed the progess we have made towards merging so far, and set an expected merge
        completion time of spring break. Jonathan also brought up the problem to Mike that there are many duplicate entries in the old
        vehicle table. Mike told him these are not useful and gave him the go-ahead to delete them.

        Over the next week I plan on continuing to work on splitting up the model-and-trim column in the Canada vehicle table.</p>
    <p><strong>2/21/19</strong>
        Slow progress, column not yet split.
        
        Some scheduling conflicts and tech problems led to a shorter than usual meeting with Mike. Jonathan discussed a problem he 
        encountered where queries would return cars whose entries were the same except for a curb weight property. Mike told him to
        return only the car with the lowest curb weight in order for the application to give the most conservative estimate. Still
        plan on merging before spring break.
    
        My goal for next week is to finish the column split.</p>
    <p><strong>2/28/19</strong>
        There was some good news this week in that Jonathan discovered a way to merge the tables without splitting the column I had
        been working on splitting. This is good for us as a whole, since there is now less work to do, but means most of what I have
        been working on has gone to waste.
    
        In this weeks meeting with Mike, we discussed how there is an issue with some discrepencies between the tables in a "curb
        weight" column. We decided to increase our tolerance for this column, so that values will be considered matched if they
        are similar, even if they are not exactly the same. We also informed him that Tyler has dropped out of the class and will
        no longer be working with us.
    
        Over the next week I will be working with the team to complete the merge.</p>
    <p><strong>3/7/19</strong>
        We completed an initial merge this past week, but there is still a lot of clean up to do. I missed the meeting with Mike 
        since I have been feeling under the weather today. I messaged the other team members and we plan on taking a break from 
        work over Spring Break.</p>
    <p><strong>3/21/19</strong>
        We did not do much work over spring break. In our meeting with Mike this week, he informed us that the work he wants us to
        do next requires the desktop team to make some more progress, so at the moment we are on standby waiting for them to finish.
        Additionally, he brought up an interest in using encryption for sending data between the database and the mobile app in the 
        future.</p>
    <p><strong>3/28/19</strong>
        We have been doing a little bit of work on maintenance. In our meeting with Mike, we learned that we are still waiting on the
        desktop team and spoke more regarding possible data encryption. We are planning on doing additional hashing for passwords as
        well. Mike also asked us to begin working on a basic password recovery system.</p>
    <p><strong>4/5/19</strong>
        Jacob and Jonathan have been working on data encryption. I have been working on the password recovery system. The encryption
        is proving to be more difficult to implement than we initially thought and there is a good chance we do not complete it in 
        our allotted time. In our meeting with Mike, he told us to spend some time collaborating with the desktop team and assisting
        them with their work.</p>
    <p><strong>4/12/19</strong>
        The work on encryption is going well, but hashing is proving to be a bit of a roadblock. My work on the password recovery
        system is going well and I expect to be done by next week. In our meeting with Mike, he told us to continue working on 
        password hashing. The semester is nearly over, so this will likely be the last work we do on this project.</p>
