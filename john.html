    <h1>Developer Notes:</h1>
    
    <p><strong>2/14/19</strong>
        Busy with schoolwork over past week, not much work to show.

        During our weekly meeting with Mike we discussed the need for security of the data we are using. We agreed on creating more tables
        that are duplicates of the current vehicle tables so we can work with them more quickly by not having to worry about accidentally
        irreversible screwing something up. We discussed the progess we have made towards merging so far, and set an expected merge
        completion time of spring break. Jonathan also brought up the problem to Mike that there are many duplicate entries in the old
        vehicle table. Mike told him these are not useful and gave him the go-ahead to delete them.

        Over the next week I plan on continuing to work on splitting up the model-and-trim column in the Canada vehicle table.</p>
    <p><strong>2/21/19</strong>
        Slow progress, column not yet split.
        
        Some scheduling conflicts and tech problems led to a shorter than usual meeting with Mike. Jonathan discussed a problem he 
        encountered where queries would return cars whose entries were the same except for a curb weight property. Mike told him to
        return only the car with the lowest curb weight in order for the application to give the most conservative estimate. Still
        plan on merging before spring break.
    
        My goal for next week is to finish the column split.</p>
